## Adding a Feature

I need a nice printable sheet for all my rates.  The default table layout doesn't look right, it should be a large compact table of readable rate lines; probably sorted by material.

How would this look?

1. on rates page, link to `/print/rates`
2. add cell, link to page
3. add component, link in cell
4. adjust output & test
